# Hlox DSL Framework

**Hlox** is a domain-specific language (DSL) and lightweight execution engine designed to simplify the development, validation, and deployment of healthcare audit specifications.  
Built with healthcare compliance and auditability in mind, Hlox allows engineers and system architects to author expressive, version-controlled audit rules that **compile directly to JVM bytecode**, ensuring runtime efficiency, transparency, and strong traceability across critical healthcare IT systems.

Hlox aims to reduce the engineering burden of creating custom audit frameworks for healthcare platforms while ensuring that audit logic remains human-readable, maintainable, and verifiable against regulatory standards.

---

## Key Features

- **Simple, Readable DSL Syntax:** Create audit rules declaratively with clear, concise statements.
- **Bytecode Compilation:** Translates audit specifications into optimized JVM bytecode for high-performance execution.
- **Versioned Rulesets:** Native support for version control and lifecycle management of audit rule deployments.
- **Compliance-Centric Design:** Tailored for healthcare audit scenarios, ensuring data traceability and operational transparency.
- **Minimal Runtime Overhead:** Extremely lightweight, embeddable audit engine ready for cloud-native environments and large-scale deployments.

---

## Core Use Cases

- Defining dynamic audit validation rules for clinical transaction workflows.
- Enabling non-developer stakeholders (compliance officers, QA analysts) to author and evolve audit logic safely.
- Building scalable, high-throughput audit validation pipelines without embedding rigid business logic in application code.
- Streamlining regulatory reporting, security event monitoring, and operational compliance for healthcare applications.

---

## Example Applications

- Real-time validation of EHR event sequences for regulatory audit trails.
- Automated audit of financial transactions in healthcare billing and claims management systems.
- Continuous compliance checking for patient admission, discharge, and transfer (ADT) workflows across hospital networks.

## Installation

Add Hlox as a dependency:

```xml
<!-- Maven -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>dev.alisa.hlox</groupId>
    <artifactId>hlox-core</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

or

```groovy
// Gradle
implementation 'dev.alisa.hlox:hlox-core:0.1.0'
```

---

## Quick Start Example

```hlox
WHEN EventType == "PatientDischarge"
AND PatientStatus == "Transferred"
THEN AuditOutcome = "PASS"
ELSE AuditOutcome = "FAIL"
```

And corresponding Java runtime usage:

```java
AuditEngine engine = new AuditEngine();
AuditResult result = engine.evaluate(eventBundle, "discharge-transfer-ruleset");
```
